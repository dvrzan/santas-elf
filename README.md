### Programming Experience

I am often sad and disappointed that I did not come into contact with programming at all until 2015, after I finished University. I graduated as a Bachelor of Civil Engineering in Zagreb, Croatia, where I am originally from. Working in that field of engineering made me realise that I didn't really like it and it wasn't what I originally expected it to be.

Nonetheless, I was very lucky to have been introduced to the IT world by my hubby, who is a Project Manager. He got tired of listening to me talking how I dislike working in CE and told me to go and try any online course on programming that I find interesting. 

My first course was in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, and me being me I instantly loved the way I got to create a simple website and design it. I am in no way a designer, but a very creative person which you will probably see in my homework assignments. I love to design assets, but I love the coding more.

I got back to school and finished my second University and got a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in Rijeka, Croatia, in September 2019. I learned some basics about computers, logic, IT in general, and programming. I wanted to build software for mobile phones, specifically iPhones because I could build something for myself. Mobile Development wasn't covered in my courses so I decided to learn it myself. Having finished CS, only helped me a little bit in understanding the basics of Swift and iOS Development. I still feel like I learned more myself in 6 months then during those 3 years. 

I moved to Toronto, Canada, right after I finished my studies and have since been learning about Swift and iOS Development. I fell in love with it and am enjoying on spending every minute I can in developing apps and learning development concepts. 

And here I am... Attending iOS bootcamp and taking the steps forward to become a Junior iOS Developer!

### Hobbies

In my free time I love to put my mind on ease and play some video games to relax and in the same time spend some time with my friends. I also read books sometimes. I mostly enjoy science-fiction and fantasy. I am a great fan of Harry Potter, The Witcher, and the whole LOTR lore.
Apart from that, I love to experiment with cooking different food, go to the gym, sketch, and spend time outside exploring Toronto's amazing restaurants!
