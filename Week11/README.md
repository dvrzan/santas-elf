### AnimatorKit

AnimatorKit is a simple animation app that uses UIKit to animate views on screen. Main menu button expands upon tap and shows 3 different buttons that correspond to 3 different animations. User can choose which animation/animations to see. when choosing the animation, an alert view will pop up to inform user that animation has been added, along with a green tick on the button.

Upon tapping the main menu button, it will collapse and the animation will start.

Upon completion, an alert view will pop up to inform the animation has finished.
